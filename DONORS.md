# MultiROM's Indiegogo campaign

http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/multirom-for-nexus-7-2013/

A crowdfunding campaign to get test devices took place from July 28th
to August 27th 2013. Thanks all contributors, the campaign was successful,
raising a total of $562. This enabled a purchase of _flo_ and resulted in
MultiROM being ported to said device and the code became much more portable.

These are the contributors who pledged $20 or more and got perk _The Code_:
* jbaumert
* viper08
* marius15
* x.nicow.x
* Ben Hagen

More contributors are named in the XDA thread or during build of
`multirom_zip` target, but thanks goes to all who contributed, either
by pledging money or by promoting the campaign. Thank you all.
